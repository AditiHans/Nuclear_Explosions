# Nuclear Explosions Data Analysis
📌 Overview

This project explores over 1,000 global nuclear explosion records (1945–1998) to identify historical, geographical, and magnitude-based trends in nuclear testing. The goal was to transform raw data into actionable insights for research and policy evaluation using data analytics and visualization techniques.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze the temporal and spatial distribution of nuclear explosions.

Examine regional testing patterns and explosion magnitudes.

Visualize historical trends and correlations across decades.
